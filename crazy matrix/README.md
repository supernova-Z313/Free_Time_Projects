## Crazy_matrix.py 🌀 🔢

A crazy spiral matrix is ​​an odd square matrix whose middle element is 1 and the numbers rotate clockwise around it. 

> 📌 (Full description and images in the **Exercise1-3.jpeg**.)

This program displays the related spiral matrix by taking the number *n* and shows the final time of its execution by the system at the end.⌚

There are 2 scripts in this folder. The first code called **Exercise1-3_myfriend_V.py** was written by one of my friends and he used a special method to solve this problem, but the second code (**crazy_matrix_V3_SF.py**), which is my code, I used another method. 

 > The result of both of them is the same. But the amount of system usage and the final time of the programs are very different. 📊
 
In small *n*'s, my friend's first program will run faster than my program and the program is better, but when the value of *n* tends to large numbers, the huge difference and the superiority of my code will be visible.📝
