# Free Time Projects
Hello 👋

This is a small collection of **Fun projects**, **Exercises**, and **Codes** that I did in my *free time* or while doing other projects when I encountered problems and tried to solve them.
        
 > Note: This collection is only Python projects .        ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

## Description 📑
Each folder contains one or more scripts. I have already written some of these codes and for now I will only put them, but I try to create a special branch for each new project and only put the final code in the main branch.

 > Note: Some of these codes are included in a comparative form or... along with some other code samples written by my friends or others, which are freely placed. 🔗
 
 > Note: Some of these codes are transferred to this repository indirectly from the uncompleted repository or from some other repositories. 🔖
 
 > Note: I tried to put a description file in each folder. 📋

### Requirements + Recommended:
* Python 3.6 or higher (my suggestion is Python 3.9, a complete version that is compatible with most libraries.) 🐍
(If a code needs a special library, it will be mentioned in the same section.)

### random:
- Some ideas that may be included in this section in the future are in the notes repository. 💡
